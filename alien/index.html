      <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
      <div class="question">
        <h5 class="text-light">Q: How much notice do you need for an event?</h5>
        <div>
          A: A minimum of 2 weeks notice is required to request an event. It is strongly recommended that you contact us even earlier, since we prioritize event requests on a first come, first serve basis.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="question">
        <h5 class="text-light">Q: Can you do events off campus?</h5>
        <div>
          A: No. Due to IIT's insurance policy, we are not allowed to do events off campus. We also can not purchase additional insurance for legal reasons, this has been looked into in the past.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="question">
        <h5 class="text-light">Q: How much does it cost to do our event?</h5>
        <div>
          A: Nothing is charged directly to your organization. In the past we charged your organization for our services, and in turn you would ask for funding through the Student Activity Fund. While this was a more "fair" way of funding Alien (since the amount
          of funding we received was directly proportionate to the events we helped with), it was also confusing to some people. We are now directly funded through the SAF so that it is easier for you and so that there are no direct charges to your organization.

      <div class="question">
        <h5 class="text-light">Q: I requested an event, but I haven't heard back from you. How do I know what the status is?</h5>
        <div>
          A: We are sorry that we haven't gotten back to you yet. Because our members are volunteers, it can sometimes be hard to work out the logistics of your event. We will generally try to give you at least one week's notice if we can't do an event, we can't
          promise much more than that. To check to see what the status is, feel free to email
          <a class="link" href="mailto:alien@iit.edu">alien@iit.edu</a>.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="question">
        <h5 class="text-light">Q: We are unable to make your event anymore. What now?</h5>
        <div>
          A: Event Services may be able to help with your events (although there may be a charge for their help). You can email them at <a class="link" href="mailto:events@iit.edu">events@iit.edu</a>. If for some reason they are unable to accommodate
          you, feel free to ask us for recommendations of companies in the area that might be able to meet your needs. Our staff has a good working relationship with many AV companies in the Chicagoland area, and chances are we know someone who would
          be perfect for your event!

      <div class="question">
        <h5 class="text-light">Q: Can I or my student organization borrow Alien's equipment if your staff isn't available?</h5>
        <div>
          A: <b>NO.</b> Per the Judicial Board decision on case number 20130301A, our equipment may only operated by trained students. If you are interested in joining us and being trained on our equipment so that you might be able to run our equipment
          for your organization in the future, feel free to email us at
          <a class="link" href="mailto:alien@iit.edu">alien@iit.edu</a>.

      <div class="question">

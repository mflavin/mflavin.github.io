          <h1>Hobbies</h1>
          <p>
            Most of my hobbies come from where I am. So since my school is in the city a lot of my hobbies involve going out downtown. This could be going to a museum, the Shedd, or some restaurant I haven't been to before. Along with the loction, it's also the people I have around me. Depending on the people will also influence my hobbies. This semester, my friends and I were on a intramural volleyball team. We also go downtown for drinks on the weekend whenever most of us are free. But if not any of that, there is a good chance I'm just in my room playing games, watching tv, or just sleeping really.
